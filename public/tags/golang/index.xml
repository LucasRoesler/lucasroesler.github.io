      <description>Go 1.18 was released last week (March 15) and I have finally had a chance to play with it. I have been excited for it in the month leading to the release, reading almost every preview that I saw on Twitter, and the release has not disappointed! I think the last release that got me this excited was 1.16, when they added embed.
Today, I want to share a few of things that made me a bit more excited than usual for a Go release.</description>

      <title>Struct embedding for custom dev responses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had to learn about Go struct embedding the other day and I wanted to document my
fix. In my use case I wanted to add some extra information to an API response to include
some meta data from kubernetes cluster and/or some extra error information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deploying a private registry in Docker Swarm</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://contiamo.com&#34;&gt;Contiamo&lt;/a&gt; I am currently working a project that will eventually integrate with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openfaas.com/&#34;&gt;OpenFaaS&lt;/a&gt;.  I am really excited about this project because we will soon bring some serverless magic to data scientists that use Contiamo.  That is, once I figure out how to deploy a private Docker registry inside a Docker Swarm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the month I left &lt;a href=&#34;https://teem.com/&#34;&gt;Teem&lt;/a&gt; I was Director of Engineering and it was and still is a great company.  There are some amazing developers there, so if you are looking for a job in SLC, hit them up.  This weekend (Aug 5) I will be moving to Berlin to start a new role at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.contiamo.com/&#34;&gt;Contiamo&lt;/a&gt; and will be working on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.contiamo.com/en/labs/&#34;&gt;Labs feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
