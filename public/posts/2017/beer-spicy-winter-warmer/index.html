                    <p>I just finished my winter beer.  I usually do one dark spicy beer for the winter
season. Last year was the &ldquo;Better Not Pout Stout&rdquo;, this year is the less
excitingly named &ldquo;Spicy Winter Porter&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="the-recipe">The recipe</h3>
<p>This is a partial mash recipe for a 5 gallon batch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grains:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 lbs Pale Malt, Maris Otter</li>
<li>1 lb Patagonia 190</li>
<li>9 lbs 12 oz Pilsner Liquid Extract</li>
</ul>
<p>Hops:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 oz Chinook for 60 mins</li>
<li>1 oz Goldings, East Kent for 30 mins</li>
<li>1 oz Centennial for 15 mins</li>
</ul>
<p>Spices:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 oz coriander for 5 mins</li>
<li>6 sticks cinnamon for 5 mins</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeast:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 pkg Safale American #US-05</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the brew I recorded an original gravity of 1.068. I always use a
secondary fermentation, which I switched to after 14 days.  When I moved from
primary to secondary I recorded a gravity of 1.036.  I left it in secondary for
about 4 weeks.  Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t actually get any fermentation in
secondary. Come bottling day I had a final gravity of 1.036.</p>
<h3 id="the-result">The result</h3>
<p>Drum roll please &hellip; Today is the first tasting day and I am moderately happy
with this batch. I will definitely have to retry the recipe later this year.
This beer came out fairly sweet with a spicy flavor in the back of the mouth.
I was originally a little nervous about the cinnamon but it is not overly
powerful.  The coriander is subtle.</p>
<h3 id="bottom-line">Bottom line</h3>
<p>Ultimately, I always look at my winter beers as a my big experiment and this
year was a mixed result.  I think it is probably sweater than I would like.
About a month ago I finished a red ale and I think I prefer that one over this
porter, but I wont be sad to drink it :)</p>
<h3 id="update">Update</h3>
<p>Letting the beer bottle age another week made a <em>huge</em> difference. The extra
sweetness went away and the extra carbonation made a big difference for the
mouth feel.  I am now willing to give this beer a hearty thumbs-up!  Just make
sure you let it fully age before you crack one open.</p>
