      <title>Event driven functions powered by Postgres</title>
      <link>https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2021/event-driven-faasd-with-postgres/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An event-driven architecture can let you seamlessly extend your application or improve the scalability, if you can handle the eventual consistency. But your app may not be ready for this yet, or you don&amp;rsquo;t own the code in the app. A recently added a feature to &lt;code&gt;faasd&lt;/code&gt; got me thinking about event driven architecture powered by the Postgres WAL. Which means we can seamlessly extend your app without needing to change the app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will show you how to quickly deploy Postgresql along with an event listener and some custom functions. From there it’s up to you what you build.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend was my first adventure in &lt;a href=&#34;https://snapcraft.io/&#34;&gt;Snaps&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, this adventure quickly devolved into a murder mystery, for my hard drive. The first snap I try to compile triggers a &amp;ldquo;disk is almost out of space&amp;rdquo; notification?! Turns out building Snaps requires a surprising amount of disk space. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely Multipass&#39; fault, my good old friend Docker was eating up a decent chunk of my disk too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://contiamo.com&#34;&gt;Contiamo&lt;/a&gt; I am currently working a project that will eventually integrate with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openfaas.com/&#34;&gt;OpenFaaS&lt;/a&gt;.  I am really excited about this project because we will soon bring some serverless magic to data scientists that use Contiamo.  That is, once I figure out how to deploy a private Docker registry inside a Docker Swarm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the month I left &lt;a href=&#34;https://teem.com/&#34;&gt;Teem&lt;/a&gt; I was Director of Engineering and it was and still is a great company.  There are some amazing developers there, so if you are looking for a job in SLC, hit them up.  This weekend (Aug 5) I will be moving to Berlin to start a new role at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.contiamo.com/&#34;&gt;Contiamo&lt;/a&gt; and will be working on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.contiamo.com/en/labs/&#34;&gt;Labs feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever have that feeling you are forgetting something right as you leave work? You are probably thinking about your keys or your lunch box but I am talking about your SSL certificate.  They don&amp;rsquo;t last forever, we know this when we setup SSL but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop it from sneaking up on us.  It has happened to the big guys like &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/04/30/oops-instagram-forgot-to-renew-its-ssl-certificate/#.tnw_9kCFpT58&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pcworld.com/article/2906216/expired-google-certificate-temporarily-disrupts-gmail-service.html&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=&#34;http://status.teem.com/incidents/ddtys5ss4mw5&#34;&gt;Teem recently&lt;/a&gt;, and of course for myself with my own home server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Your API&#39;s rat nest</title>
      <link>https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2017/api-rats-nest/</link>

      <guid>https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2017/api-rats-nest/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have seen several articles talking about RESTful API design.  Of
course this is also a common topic of discussion for the engineers at Teem.  I
want to use (and write) APIs that are easy to understand and explain and the
fastest way to complicate your API is nested routes. Just don&amp;rsquo;t do it! Do not
create nested routes in your API.  Let&amp;rsquo;s keep our APIs simple and create one
endpoint per resource and if filters are needs, use GET parameters. This is
simpler to document and simpler to maintain and ultimately, easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Take Care of Your People</title>
      <link>https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2017/take-care-of-your-people/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started this blog, I started with &lt;a href=&#34;https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2017/management-philosophy/&#34;&gt;My Management Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.  In short,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be a multiplier for your team and reduce friction&amp;hellip;
Successful managers make other people better at their jobs, “multiplying”
their productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I wrote this, I was focusing on the ideas as a guide. &amp;ldquo;Should I do X?
Does it multiply my team&amp;rsquo;s effort?  Does it simplify their job?&amp;rdquo; Underlying
this is that good leadership requires &lt;em&gt;empathy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Living Our Culture at Teem via Peer Reviews</title>
      <link>https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2017/how-we-live-the-teem-engineering-values/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2017 12:16:11 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2017/how-we-live-the-teem-engineering-values/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a year ago we set down to document the core values of the engineering at
Teem. After a lot of discussion we narrowed it to three core ideas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maximize positive impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;communicate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be a good friend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add one more unofficial value: mentorship and continuous learning.
About the same time we also started thinking about how we describe/define an
engineers career path and we quickly realized that measuring progress is hard
and that measuring commitment to our core values is even harder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the one piece of ubiquitous technology that you will find at any new
tech company is &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;.  There are a couple of other technologies that you will
probably find, like AWS, but &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; is the only one I expect to find everywhere. It is
also, surprisingly, many developers number one frienemy.  I want to share some
of my favorite tips and tweaks that I have used over the years to make it all
friend and never my enemy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Zero downtime deploys: A tale of Django migrations</title>
      <link>https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2017/automatic-migration-validation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2017/automatic-migration-validation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Teem, we aim for zero down-time deploys; so, one of the most
important things we must validate is that things will not break mid-deploy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most sensitive step of the deploy process is the changes to our database.
Prior to the automation I am about to describe, validation of the database
migrations required specialized knowledge about Postgres, the changes to the
application model, load on the database for that model, and a bit of general
experience. This obviously slows down reviews and subsequently deploys. Worse,
it was simply too easy to miss problem migrations when depending on only peer
reviews. To make our lives easier we created a series of validation checks to
ensure that each database migration will be backwards compatible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I was having lunch with a friend when he asked what resources I
use to learn about management and tech leadership in general. I will share
some recommendations at the end, but my answer to him got me thinking about
my philosophy around management and how to be good at it, which is what I really
want to share here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: be a multiplier for your team and reduce friction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
