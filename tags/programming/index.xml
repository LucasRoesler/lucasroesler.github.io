      <title>A foray into OpenTelemetry with OpenFaaS</title>
      <link>https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2021/opentelemetry-and-openfaas/</link>

      <description>I have always been a fan of tracing. My first taste of it was with NewRelic, but the development of OpenTracing and more recently OpenTelemetry have made it an easy must have in every project I start. I have created a new walk-through: Tracing and Observability with OpenFaaS to show you how to add OpenTelemetry to your Python Flask functions.
 This post won&amp;rsquo;t go through the walk-through, the walk-through already does that.</description>

      <title>Easy settings management for Python functions with Pydantic</title>
      <link>https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2021/pydantic-settings-for-openfaas-functions/</link>

      <description>File this under quick tips and tricks for Python functions in OpenFaas.
I just learned about Pydantic&amp;rsquo;s support for reading settings from secret files and it fits perfectly with secrets in OpenFaaS. If you love Python or you are writing Python functions in OpenFaas, this is a great way to simplify your configuration parsing.
I am going to keep this short and sweet. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have an OpenFaas function that needs to access a database.</description>

      <title>Using Tox and PyTest with OpenFaaS</title>
      <link>https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2021/test-python-functions/</link>

      <description>I think it is an uncontroversial statement to say testing is important in software development. Writing tests may not always be fun, but nothing is a sweet as that moment when a unit test catches a bug before you deploy.
In OpenFaaS we have tons of tests in each project, even the certifier itself runs a short suite of end-to-end tests. But, not all of our function templates have first class testing support.</description>

      <title>Event driven functions powered by Postgres</title>
      <link>https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2021/event-driven-faasd-with-postgres/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An event-driven architecture can let you seamlessly extend your application or improve the scalability, if you can handle the eventual consistency. But your app may not be ready for this yet, or you don&amp;rsquo;t own the code in the app. A recently added a feature to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openfaas/faasd&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;faasd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; got me thinking about event driven architecture powered by the Postgres WAL. Which means we can seamlessly extend your app without needing to change the app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will show you how to quickly deploy Postgresql along with an event listener and some custom functions. From there itâ€™s up to you what you build.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend was my first adventure in &lt;a href=&#34;https://snapcraft.io/&#34;&gt;Snaps&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, this adventure quickly devolved into a murder mystery, for my hard drive. The first snap I try to compile triggers a &amp;ldquo;disk is almost out of space&amp;rdquo; notification?! Turns out building Snaps requires a surprising amount of disk space. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely Multipass&#39; fault, my good old friend Docker was eating up a decent chunk of my disk too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had a week long battle implementing HTTP long-polling. As so often
happens in long debugging session in software development, my final fix was
one line!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Struct embedding for custom dev responses</title>
      <link>https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2018/golang-struct-embedding/</link>

      <guid>https://lucasroesler.com/posts/2018/golang-struct-embedding/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had to learn about Go struct embedding the other day and I wanted to document my
fix. In my use case I wanted to add some extra information to an API response to include
some meta data from kubernetes cluster and/or some extra error information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://contiamo.com&#34;&gt;Contiamo&lt;/a&gt; I am currently working a project that will eventually integrate with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openfaas.com/&#34;&gt;OpenFaaS&lt;/a&gt;.  I am really excited about this project because we will soon bring some serverless magic to data scientists that use Contiamo.  That is, once I figure out how to deploy a private Docker registry inside a Docker Swarm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the one piece of ubiquitous technology that you will find at any new
tech company is &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;.  There are a couple of other technologies that you will
probably find, like AWS, but &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; is the only one I expect to find everywhere. It is
also, surprisingly, many developers number one frienemy.  I want to share some
of my favorite tips and tweaks that I have used over the years to make it all
friend and never my enemy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
