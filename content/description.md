### A few more details ####
I have been a core contributor to [OpenFaas][openfaas] since 2017. I implemented the secrets, logs, and profiles features as well as general contributions throughout the rest of the project including `faas-swarm`, `faas-netes`, `faasd`, the `faas-provider`, the `certifier`, and the Python function SDK.


At [Contiamo GmbH][contiamo] I am a senior engineer and lead the Platform team. We design the core architecture, operational and observability tooling, and the public API of Contiamo's DataHub platform. Primiarly working with Go and Python.

At the [University of Connecticut][uconn] I completed my Ph.D. studying combinatorics, tilting theory, and cluster algebras with [Ralf Schiffler][ralf].
