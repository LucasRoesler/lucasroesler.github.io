Anyone that knows that knows me also knows that breakfast (American breakfast) is one of my favorite meals. Eggs, bacon, pancakes, waffles, home fries, coffee, orange juice, and more. I love it all. Cooking is not something I normally talk about. However, for various reasons, I have needed to learn more about gluten free cooking and I have finally found/create a recipe for gluten free pancakes. I am tired of recreating it and looking up various conversions, so I writing it down here.

## Pancakes:

This recipe is small modification of [a recipe from Schar](https://www.schaer.com/en-int/r/american-pancakes). The main change is that the original recipe used 2 eggs, but one day I was missing an egg and had to create a replacement.

### Ingredients:

- 250 g Schar Universal Gluten Free Flour
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 g baking powder

- 250 ml oat milk
- 1 egg
- 1 "replacement egg"

### Replacemet Egg

- 1.5 tbsp veg oil
- 1.5 tbsp water
- 4.5 g baking power

### Preparation

1. Mix the dry ingredients
2. Add the wet ingredients and mix until mostly smooth. It should have a liquid but somewhat thick consistency.
3. Let the mix rest for ~30 minutes.

   - I usually remove the syrup from the fridge at this time.

4. Warm a pan to medium heat

   - I also start the oven on a cool temperature like 50 C, while I am cooking I put the pancakes in the over to stay warm.

5. Use a large spoon to scoop the batter and make a dozen or more pancakes.

   - Use a little butter in the pan.
