#### Talks / Publications
**Event Driven Postgres with OpenFaas**, Livestream with Alex Elis - **2021-02-02**
> We discuss how you can combine the Postgres WAL, NATS, and OpenFaaS to create a lightweight event driven architecture. Including a short demo of a simple "event echo" to prove the concept. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOZLOjg5Zs

**OpenFaaS Blog**
> - [*Time travelling through your OpenFaaS Function logs*](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/openfaas-loki-into/) - **2020-06-06**
> - [*How to Serve Data Science Models with OpenFaaS*](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/python-datascience-with-openfaas/) - **2020-06-04**
> - [*How to split large Python Functions across multiple files*](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/multifile-python-functions/) - **2019-01-29**

**Merging Quickly in a Cloud Native World**, Kubecon, Barcelona - **2019**
> You are really excited by a new project, you have a great idea to contribute, you click submit ... and wait. The latest StackOverflow community report states that 80% of surveyed developers are coding in their free time but only 44% are contributing to open source projects. While this number seems good, can we do better? How can we ensure that both contributors and maintainers enjoy and benefit from participating?
>
> In this presentation Lucas goes behind the scenes of the OpenFaaS project to share his knowledge from contributing to OpenFaaS and becoming a core contributor. We will walk through the standard git flow to understand what the maintainers of a large open-source project are looking for in new contributions, what we are doing to improve the experience, what the Kubernetes community at large is working on to help, and what you can do to get your pull request merged more quickly.
